Types of statistics-

1) Descriptive :  It consist of organizing and summarizing of data
                  Measure of central tendency (mean mode median)
                  Measure of Dispersion( variance standardDeviation)
                  
2) Inferential:   Get conclusions or inferences for the specific data (popluation data) from collected data 
                  by performing some experiments(Z test,t test).

eg) like a college A of 1000 students 
v pick class statisics of height of random students 
{180,170,162,150,160}cm                 
so by descriptive we can find mean median     so v can say avg=165

for 1000 student we give avg height of college by estimating the sample data to give conculsions 
so 1000 student is population data 


LEC- 3 
population (N)   sample(n)
coz if u have to measure avg weight of 100k people it would be better to pick sample 10k data from it and draw out 
conclusion for 100k

##--------------     Lec 4
Mean= average
Median = arrange them in sorted order then return middle element


##--------------     Lec 5
Measure of dispersion

-Variance
-Standart Deviation

age={2,2,4,4}                          ages2={1,1,5,5}
mean= 3                                mean=3
spread is less(btw 2,4)                 spread is more(btw 1,5)

##--------------     Lec 7
Variance gives the spread,dispersion
Standard deviation gives how far u r away from mean


##--------------     Lec8
variable types-
              Quantitative (it has two types 
                                  - Discrete  eg) whole numbers only 
                                   - Continuous  eg) Decimal can be     )
                                      
               Qualitative (categorical )-
                                eg) colors (orange,green)

##--------------     Lec9
Random variable - 
               is a fxn whose values are determined by various experiments or processes
            types
                -Discrete random variabl= eg) tossing a coin, rolling a dice
                -Continous random variable = eg) tomorrow how much inches it can ranin (0,1.5,,,, ... can go infinite) ,  Height of the people attending event tomorrow

##--------------     Lec10
Histogram :   it's just drawing graph using frequency in range u select 





##--------------     Lec11
Percentile- 
            It is a value below which certain percentage of observations lies
     formula- 
            Percentile of value x = (no. of values below x / n ) * 100
        
        if percentile is given then to find value 
            value = (Percentile/100) * (n+1)
        
Quartile-
          25%ile = 1 quartile ,    50%ile = 2nd quartile , 75%ile= 3rd quartile

##--------------     Lec12
5 NUmber summary
1- Minimum
2- 1st quartile(25%ile)
3-Median
4- 3rd quartile(75%ile)
5- Maximum

eg--       1,2,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,8,8,9,27
as u can see 27 is outlier (jo baaki sab kaafi durri pe ho )
so for removing outliers we founds lower fence , Higher fence  so anything outside this range get removes

Lower fence=     Q1  - 1.5(IQR)                   # q1 is first quartile and Iqr is diff between q1 and q3 
Higher fence =   Q3  + 1.5(IQR)

Q1 = (Percentile /100 )*(n+1)                     # n is total no. of observation as per  above eg n=19
Q1= (25/100)  *  (19+1)    
   = 5th position                                so 5th position ki value 
   = 3

Q3= (75/100)*20  = 15th position = 7

IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 7-3 = 4

Lower fence = Q1 - 1.5(4) = -3 
Higher fence = Q3 + 1.5(IQR)= 7+1.5*4 = 13

so values below -3  and greater than 13  are outliers so remove them and rwrite expression

------  new=       1,2,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,8,8,9
minimum = 1 
Q1= 3   (above calculated)
Median new wali sai mid nikal le  i.e. =  5
Q3 = third quartile = 7     (calculated above)
Maximum = 9


By this 5 results we can plot  Box plot 



##--------------     Lec13   Correlation and Covariance

Covariance and correlation are two statistical measures used to determine the relationship between two variables(continuous variables) 
Both r used to understand how changes in one variable(continuous variables) are associated with changes in another variable

Covariance- 
        It is a measure of how much two random variables change together.
        If the variables tend to increase and decrease together, the covariance is positive.
        If one tends to increase when the other decreases, the covariance is negative.
    # see formula in copies 

Advantage of covariance -
                        Quantify the relationship between x and y 
Disadvantage of covariance-
                Covariance doesn't have a specific limit value eg) x,y,z
                we can't say that Cov(x,y) > or < than Cov(z,x)  so for this 
         Correlation comes in picture 


Correlation-
            Types-
                Pearson Correlation coefficient
                Spearman Rank Correlation
    
    -Pearson Correlation coefficent: 
                                    it limits the value in range [-1,1]
                                    formula in copy
    -Spearman Correlation coefficient:
                                     pearson works for linear graph between x and y while spearman works for non linear graph btw x &y
