Probability Distribution Fxn-
            It describe how the probabilities are distributed over the values of random variable
        Two types of probability distributn
          -Probability mass fxn -
                            used for discrete random variable
          - Probability density fxn-
                            used for continous random variable

@2nd lec-------

-Bernoulli Distribution -> Outcomes are binary(0,1) here (pmf) so it meant for discrete random variable
-Binomial Distribution->  pmf
-Normal/gaussian distribution -> pdf
-Poisson => pmf
-> Log Normal Distribution -> pdf
->  Uniform Distribution  -> pmf
